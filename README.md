Python library for conducting hypothesis and other group comparison tests.

## Available Methods

### Hypothesis Testing

* t-test (one and two-sample)

### Nonparametric Methods

* Mann-Whitney (two sample nonparametric variant of t-test)
* Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (one sample nonparametric variant of paired and one-sample t-test)

### Analysis of Variance

* Analysis of Variance

## Other Features and Utilities

### Correlation and Covariance

* Pearson Correlation
* Spearman Correlation
* Covariance
  - Several algorithms for computing the covariance and covariance matrix of 
    sample data are available

### Critical Value Tables

* Wilcoxon Rank Sum W Statistic
